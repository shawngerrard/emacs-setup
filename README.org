* DOOM EMACS setup
A guide to installing and configuring my DOOM EMACS setup.

* Pre-requisites :prereqs:
You need to ensure the following dependencies are installed to follow this guide successfully.

- Ubuntu LTS (currently 22.04+)

  #+begin_quote
*Note*: It's recommended that you follow my [[https://github.com/shawngerrard/ubuntu-tooling][guide to installing and configuring Ubuntu]].
  #+end_quote

- Git 2.23+
- [[Https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep][ripgrep]] (11.01)
- (Optional) [[https://github.com/sharkdp/fd][fd]]

* Installing EMACS :installingemacs:

The first step is to install the base vanilla Gnu-EMACS application compatible with DOOM. For the purposes of this guide, we'll be installing *Gnu-EMACS version 28.1*. At this point in time, the minimum required EMACS version is 27.1.

#+begin_quote
*Note*: You'll need to review the [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs#prerequisites][DOOM prerequisites for EMACS]] to identify the EMACS versions compatible with DOOM.
#+end_quote

** Installing EMACS using the Ubuntu apt package manager :apt:

To get up and running quickly, you can install ~emacs~ using the ~apt~ package manager.

The general repositories used in Ubuntu 20.04 and 22.04 (focal, jammy, etc) run older versions of Emacs (26). These aren't compatible with DOOM.

You will need to use a Personal Package Archive (PPA) to install a newer version of Emacs in Ubuntu. A recommended PPA is 'kelleyk/emacs' and can be added with the following:

#+begin_src bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:kelleyk/emacs
#+end_src

Now we should be able to install a newer version of Emacs through the ~apt~ package manager.

#+begin_src bash
sudo apt install emacs28
#+end_src

To uninstall ~emacs~ you'll need to also remove all dependencies.

#+begin_src bash
sudo apt-get remove emacs emacs28 emacs-bin-common emacs-common emacs-el && sudo apt autoremove
#+end_src

** (Recommended) Installing EMACS by building from source :source:

You'll need the following packages installed to build the ~emacs~ source.

#+begin_src bash
libcurses-dev libgnutls28-dev gnutls-bin pkg-config
#+end_src

Then, obtain the source code tarball for the specific version you want. In this case, we're installing version 28.1.

#+begin_src bash
wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/emacs-28.1.tar.xz
#+end_src

Extract the source code from the tarball.

#+begin_src bash
tar xvf emacs-28.1.tar.xz
#+end_src

Finally, configure, build, and install ~emacs~ using the scipts supplied with the source files.

#+begin_src bash
cd emacs-28.1
./configure
sudo make
sudo make install
#+end_src

You should now be able to start ~emacs~ successfully.

#+begin_quote
*Note*: To uninstall ~emacs~ you can follow the step above but instead of ~sudo make install~ you can run ~sudo make uninstall~
#+end_quote

* Installing DOOM :installingdoom:

Run the following command to clone the DOOM configuration to your local computer:

#+begin_src bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs ~/.config/emacs
~/.config/emacs/bin/doom install
#+end_src

Add the Emacs binary files to the ~PATH~ environment variable, if you haven't already. You'll need to add the following line to the bottom of your ~​~/.bashrc~ configuration file:

#+begin_src bash
export PATH="~/.config/emacs/bin:$PATH"
#+end_src

If you have any private ~emacs~ configuration to sync with DOOM, or if you've made changes to ~init.el~ or ~packages.el~, you'll need to run ~doom sync~.

Finally, to run the new setup, use ~doom run~ in the terminal. You should be met with the DOOM landing screen.

#+begin_quote
*Note*: Visit [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs][the official DOOM GitHub repository]] for more information if you have any installation issues.
#+end_quote

* Alternative - Install DOOM and apply configuration to EMACS

You can find information on the DOOM configuration framework for ~emacs~ in the [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs#introduction][DOOMEMACS github repository]].

It's recommended that you ensure your system is up-to-date.

#+begin_src bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
#+end_src

Now, we clone the DOOM configuration from git into the ~$HOME/emacs.d~ directory, and use the ~doom install~ function from the binary.

#+begin_src bash
git clone https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs ~/.emacs.d
~/.emacs.d/bin/doom install
#+end_src

#+begin_quote
*Note*: Ensure that you have an SSH authentication key-pair loaded into git and the local ssh-agent. You may need to add this code to your ~bashrc~ configuration.
#+end_quote

You should be able to run ~doom doctor~ to diagnose any problems associated with an installation or with the system configuration.

The next time you open ~emacs~, your DOOM configuration should be loaded.

* Customizations

I've added customizations and modules to EMACS that are helpful in my workflow. Consult the sections below for updating your Emacs world.

** Configuration

My [[.config/doom][configuration]] for DOOM can be copied into the ~​~/.config/doom~ folder to retain all config below. Alternatively, assuming this repository resides within ~​~/documents~, you can execute the following code to use ~symlinks~ instead:

#+begin_src bash
ln -s ~/documents/emacs-setup/.config/doom/config.el ~/.config/doom/config.el
ln -s ~/documents/emacs-setup/.config/doom/custom.el ~/.config/doom/custom.el
ln -s ~/documents/emacs-setup/.config/doom/init.el ~/.config/doom/init.el
ln -s ~/documents/emacs-setup/.config/doom/packages.el ~/.config/doom/packages.el
#+end_src

** Packages

For some custom packages/EmacsLisp files that I want EMACS to load, I've created the directory ~​~/packages~ to hold these files.

Then, to ensure that the packages will be recognized by EMACS when it initializes, we add the following line to ~​~/.config/doom/config.el~:

#+begin_src elisp
(let ((default-directory (expand-file-name "~/packages/")))
  (normal-top-level-add-subdirs-to-load-path))
#+end_src

#+begin_quote
This allows us to add the ~​~/packages~ directory and all sub-directories to the Emacs load-path
#+end_quote

** Theme

I replace the ~doom-theme~ variable in ~config.el~ with the following:

#+begin_src elisp
(setq doom-theme 'doom-horizon)
#+end_src

I also create a ~custom.el~ file with the following code:

#+begin_src elisp
(custom-set-faces
 '(font-lock-comment-face ((t (:foreground "color-173" :slant italic)))))
#+end_src

This will update some of the font faces that are harder to see with my setup.

** Org-Agenda

I've made an update to ~​~/.config/doom/init.el~ to change the directory that ~org-agenda~ uses to find TODO items (~​~/documents/*~).

At the bottom of the ~init.el~ file, I've inserted the following code:

#+begin_src elisp
(setq org-agenda-files (directory-files-recursively "~/documents/" "\\.org$"))
#+end_src

Restart DOOMEMACS to apply changes. When prompted, select ~n~ to avoid importing variables from other org files outside of this directory.

** Org-Roam

I use [[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam][org-roam]] as a mind-mapping tool and as a local knowledge-base. I.E - my [[https://github.com/shawngerrard/second-brain][second-brain]].

First, we must create a folder to hold our ~.org~ roam files. For this, I clone/pull [[https://github.com/shawngerrard/second-brain][second-brain]] from my private ~git~ repo. ~mkdir~ somewhere will work just as well.

#+begin_src bash
git clone git@github.com:shawngerrard/second-brain.git ~/documents/second-brain
#+end_src

Installing ~org-roam~ in DOOM as is simple as opening ~init.el~ and updating the ~:lang org~ package to pass in the roam flags. We do this by replacing ~org~ in ~init.el~ to ~(org +roam2)~.

#+begin_quote
*Note*: Using the DOOM ~org-roam~ package will "pin" the package at a specific commit - this is so that DOOM can maintain stability. If you use ~org-roam-ui~ (as I do - see below!), you may need to bump the ~org-roam~ package to keep up with the ~org-roam-ui~ updates. You can do this by using ~M-x doom/bump-package-at-point~ (with your cursor over the package! statement in ~packages.el~). This will generate a ~:pin~ with the the latest commit for the package, which should save you the trouble of guessing where every package is installed.
#+end_quote

We must also update our ~config.el~ file with the following:

#+begin_src elisp
(setq org-roam-directory (file-truename "~/documents/second-brain/"))
(setq find-file-visit-truename t)
(org-roam-db-autosync-mode)
#+end_src

#+begin_quote
*Note*: The above code will set the scanning roam directory for ~.org~ files to ~​~/documents/second-brain/~. You can set this to any other directory as you wish. The next line will instruct Emacs to resolve symlinks. The final line ensures that ~org-roam~ syncs file changes with its cache (sqlite3).
#+end_quote

Now, run ~doom sync -u~ to reload your configuration. You should be able to view the ~org-roam~ command menu in Doom by pressing ~SPC n r~.

Please review [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyhPmypHDEw&t=635s&ab_channel=SystemCrafters][SystemCrafter's useful video]] to learn how to use ~org-roam~.

** Org-Roam capture templates

In the [[https://github.com/shawngerrard/second-brain][second-brain]] repository, I make use of ~org-roam-capture~ templates. These allow me to create similar ~org-roam~ nodes with a consistent structure, as well as speed-up the process of creating nodes.

To do this, we need to update our ~init.el~ with the following:

#+begin_src elisp
(setq org-roam-capture-templates
      '(("d" "default" plain
         "%?"
         :if-new (file+head "%<%Y%m%d%H%M%S>-${slug}.org" "#+Title: ${title}\n")
         :unnarrowed t)
        ("p" "exo-planets" plain (file "~/documents/second-brain/templates/exoplanet.org")
          :if-new (file+head "%<%Y%m%d%H%M%S>-${slug}.org" "#+Title: ${title}\n")
          :unnarrowed t)
        )
      )
#+end_src

#+begin_quote
*Note*: We keep the "default" setting to ensure that we can continue to create blank nodes.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
*Note*: Please ensure that the filepath in the form above is pointing to the correct template according to your system.
#+end_quote

** Org-Roam-UI

~Org-roam-ui~ is a fantastic front-end UI for exploring my ~org-roam~ [[https://github.com/shawngerrard/second-brain][second-brain]].

[[https://github.com/shawngerrard/emacs-setup/blob/main/org-roam-ui-example.png]]

For information relating to this ~org-roam~ UI overlay, visit [[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam-ui][the org-roam-ui github repository]].

To install, because we use Doom we must first unpin the ~org-roam~ package. This is because ~org-roam-ui~ tries to keep up with the latest features of ~org-roam~. We also must enable the ~org-roam-ui~ package. We can do all of this in our ~packages.el~ with the following:

#+begin_src elisp
(unpin! org-roam)
(package! org-roam-ui)
#+end_src

We must then update our ~config.el~ to use the ~websocket~ package and the ~org-roam-ui~ package. Doing this will install a local server where we can interrogate our second-brain in a UI rendered in our default browser. Update ~config.el~ with the following:

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package! websocket
      :after org-roam)

(use-package! org-roam-ui
  :after org-roam ;; or :after org
;;         normally we'd recommend hooking orui after org-roam, but since org-roam does not have
;;         a hookable mode anymore, you're advised to pick something yourself
;;         if you don't care about startup time, use
;;  :hook (after-init . org-roam-ui-mode)
  :config
  (setq org-roam-ui-sync-theme t
        org-roam-ui-follow t
        org-roam-ui-update-on-save t
        org-roam-ui-open-on-start t))
#+end_src

Finally, run ~doom sync -u~ to install the packages.

Finally, once the sync is complete, we must do the following to access our swish ~org-roam-ui~:

    - Start our local webserver with the following command: ~M-x org-roam-ui-mode RET~
    - Access [[http://127.0.0.1:35901/][http://127.0.0.1:35901/]] to view our UI served from our local webserver.

#+begin_quote
*NOTE*: While the ~org-roam-ui-mode~ is enabled, the websocket should interpret changes to our ~org-roam~ nodes and update the UI in real-time.
#+end_quote

** Fountain mode

I use [[https://github.com/rnkn/fountain-mode][Fountain mode]] as my main screenwriting program in EMACS. For more information about Fountain mode, visit [[https://fountain.io][https://fountain.io]].

Make sure to refer to the [[https://fountain.io/syntax/][documentation regarding syntax formatting for .fountain files]].

To install:

1. Clone the Fountain mode files into the ~​~/packages~ directory.

    #+begin_src bash
    git clone git@github.com:rnkn/fountain-mode.git ~/packages/fountain-mode
    #+end_src

2. Add the following line to ~​~/.config/doom/config.el~:

    #+begin_src elisp
    (require 'fountain-mode)
    #+end_src

3. Restart EMACS.

4. Test the file by opening a ~.fountain~ file.

   #+begin_quote
You can download a sample ~.fountain~ file with the following command: ~wget https://fountain.io/_downloads/Big-Fish.fountain~
   #+end_quote


** ~VTerm~

I use ~vterm~ as a terminal emulation application within DOOM.

**** Installing vterm

This can be installed pretty easily by uncommenting the ~vterm~ line in ~init.el~ and running ~doom sync~, however if you attempt to use ~vterm~ (~M-x vterm~) you'll be asked to compile the application first.

#+begin_quote
*Note*: If you encounter an error advising you to install libtools, you can run the following command in the terminal.

#+begin_src bash
# Install libtools-bin and cmake
sudo apt-get install libtool-bin cmake
#+end_src
#+end_quote

**** Starting vterm during DOOM startup

I've added a hook into ~init.el~ to append the application to the ~window-setup-hook~ variable so it starts when DOOM launches.

#+begin_src elisp
;; Hook to start vterm automatically during DOOM startup
(add-hook 'window-setup-hook #'vterm 'append)
#+end_src

** Treemacs

I use ~treemacs~ to add a drawer-style UI to DOOM, similar to [[https://code.visualstudio.com/][VS Code]].

**** Installing treemacs

This can be installed by uncommenting the ~treemacs~ line in ~init.el~ and running ~doom sync~.

**** Opening the treemacs drawer

You can open the ~treemacs~ drawer by using ~M-X treemacs~.

**** Configuring treemacs

***** Configuring the active workspace to display

By default, I prefer ~treemacs~ to open my ~documents~ folder in the workspace.

To do this, press ~M-x treemacs-edit-workspaces~. We can add multiple projects/folders to the workspace by putting the definition ~​~/documents~ under the *perspectives* heading.

***** Configuring icons / font

By default, typically the icons in ~treemacs~ cannot be found, resulting in malformed icons.

To allow the correct icons to show, we must do the following:

1. Download and extract a ~nerd-font~ from the [[https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads][official nerd-font website]]. I use the ~JetBrainsMono~ font.

   #+begin_src bash
# Download the JetBrainsMono font
wget https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v3.1.1/JetBrainsMono.zip

# Unzip the font files into a subdirectory called JetBrainsMono
unzip JetBrainsMono.zip -d ./JetBrainsMono
   #+end_src

2. Install the fonts.

   *If using Windows or WSL*, you need to use the ~windows terminal~ settings to update the fonts. Pressing ~CTRL+,~ will open the settings menu. Update the ~font-face~ setting found in the left-hand menu ~Profiles > Defaults~ then click ~appearance~.

   *If using Ubuntu*, fonts are typically installed in the user font directory under ~​~/.local/share~. To do this, we must perform the following:

   #+begin_src bash
# Create the directory under /.local/share
mkdir ~/.local/share/fonts

# Move the fonts into the new directory above
mv /path/to/extracted/fonts/* ~/.local/share/fonts/
   #+end_src

3. Install the fonts into DOOM using ~M-x install-package nerd-icons~

4. Update ~config.el~ with the following:

   #+begin_src lisp
;; Use the nerd-icons package
(require 'nerd-icons)

;; Install the package into treemacs
(use-package treemacs-nerd-icons
  :config
  (treemacs-load-theme "nerd-icons"))

;; Configure treemacs to use a specific nerd-font
(setq nerd-icons-font-family "JetBrainsMono Nerd Font Mono")
   #+end_src

**** Using treemacs

Documentation for treemacs can be found in the [[https://github.com/Alexander-Miller/treemacs][offcial github page]].

**** Help within treemacs

You can open a hydra containing option keys you can use from within the ~treemacs~ drawer. You need to change to the ~treemacs~ window and use the ~?~ key.

**** Starting treemacs during DOOM startup

I've added a hook into ~init.el~ to append the application to the ~window-setup-hook~ variable so it starts when DOOM launches.

#+begin_src elisp
;; Hook to start treemacs automatically during DOOM startup
(add-hook 'window-setup-hook #'treemacs 'append)
#+end_src

* Useful DOOM keybinds

By default, I run DOOMEMACS in ~evil~ mode, which means that keybinds in EMACS emulate ~vi/vim~ keybinds.

** Legend for US Keyboard layout

- ~M-~ is short for "Meta key" and is bound to ~ALT~
- ~C-~ is short for "Control key" and is bound to ~CTRL~
- ~S-~ is short for "Super key" and is bound to ~SHIFT~
- ~SPC-~ is known as a "Leader" key:
  - *In evil-mode* this is bound to ~SPC~.

  #+begin_quote
*Note*: You must change to evil-mode to use the leader key in DOOMEMACS.
  #+end_quote

  #+begin_quote
*Note*: ~SPC-u~ is bound to ~universal-argument~ which is used to input into many commands, such as shrinking/enlarging windows/buffers. The traditional equivalent in EMACS is ~C-u~.
  #+end_quote

** Keybinds

*** Disable evil-mode

*Rationale*: Some of the descriptions in documentation (such as ~SPC-h~ or ~M-x~) for DOOMEMACS are intended for SPACEMACS users rather than ~vi/vim~ users, which can be confusing as simple keybinds for /killing/yanking/ etc are different from what is stated.

Easiest way to disable evil-mode is to toggle is with: ~M-x evil-mode~

#+begin_quote
*Note*: This will only toggle evil-mode for the current EMACS session. To disable evil-mode permanently, refer to the StackExchange forum post: [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/53319/how-to-disable-evil-mode-everywhere][https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/53319/how-to-disable-evil-mode-everywhere]]
#+end_quote

*** Insert a link snippet (E.G - a URL)

Insert a URL with ~C-c C-l~ and paste in the URL.

*** Kill/yank commands

I prefer using the ~mark~ functionality to select text. You can set a mark by using ~C-SPC~, then use your left/right keys to highlight the text you want to manipulate.

Then, press any of the operations as per below to operate over the text accordingly.

***** Evil mode

- Copy: ~y~
- Cut: ~d~
- Paste: ~P~ or ~S-p~

***** Default mode

- Copy: ~M-w~
- Cut: ~C-w~
- Paste: ~C-y~
- Kill rest of line: ~C-k~

*** Insert an escape character

*Rationale*: When inserting a file path into the start of a code block, such as ~​~/documents/~, this can create formatting issues when the org file is rendered, requiring us to place an escape character beside the initial tilde.

Insert a ~zero width space~ beside the first tilde with ~C-x 8 <RET> zero width space <RET>~.

*** Traverse org-mode headings

- Move to the parent heading: ~C-c C-u~
- Move to the prev heading: ~C-c C-p~
- Move to the next heading: ~C-c C-n~
- Move to the prev heading on the same level: ~C-c C-b~
- Move to the next heading on the same level: ~C-c C-f~

*** Shrink/Enlarge windows

- Shrink a window to fit its content: ~C-x -~
- Shrink or enlarge a window by an argument value (negative values shrink): ~SPC-u <value> C-x ^~

** Org-mode shortcuts

You can shortcut some useful EMACS commands in ~org-mode~ by inserting certain characters and pressing keys.

*** Insert a code snippet

You can create a code snippet in an org file by prefixing with ~<s~ and pressing ~tab~.

*** Insert a quote block

You can create a quote block in an org file by prefixing with ~<q~ and pressing ~tab~.
